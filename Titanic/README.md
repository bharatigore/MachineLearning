# 🚢 Titanic Case Study: Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📝 Overview

This case study focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a Logistic Regression model. The Titanic disaster is one of the most well-known shipwrecks, and this case study serves as a classic example of binary classification in machine learning.

## 🚀 Introduction

The Titanic disaster is one of history's most infamous shipwrecks, and it serves as a poignant example of the challenges faced in predictive modeling. In this project, we explore the use of logistic regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## 🚀 Case Study Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
- **Model Development:** Implementing and training a Logistic Regression model to predict survival.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

## 📊 Dataset Details

The dataset includes the following features:

- **PassengerId:** Unique ID for each passenger.
- **Survived:** 0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived.
- **Pclass:** Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name:** Name of the passenger.
- **Sex:** Gender of the passenger.
- **Age:** Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket:** Ticket number.
- **Fare:** Passenger fare.
- **Cabin:** Cabin number.
- **Embarked:** Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
